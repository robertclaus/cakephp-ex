<div>This game is designed for one screen designated as the display and other players using their own device for the controller.  The display and controller connect through a Node.js websocket server.  The controller is designed for a touch device and supports multi-touch.  Currently only the latest display opened will function correctly.  There is a tendency for the websocket server to close connections when there is no display to pass them to, so if anything isn't working refresh the display followed by all the controllers.</div>
